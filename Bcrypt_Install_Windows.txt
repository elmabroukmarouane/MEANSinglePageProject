If you haven't got python installed along with all the node-gyp dependencies, simply open Powershell or Git Bash with administrator privileges and execute:

npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

and then to install the package:

npm install --global node-gyp

once installed, you will have all the node-gyp dependencies downloaded, but you still need the environment variable. Validate Python is indeed found in the correct folder:

C:\Users\<your-username-windows>\.windows-build-tools\python27\python.exe
